Data Analysis Portfolio
Introduction

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects where I've applied my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to extract insights and drive informed decision-making.
Projects

    Project 1: 
    Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on
Forage - February 2024

 * Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client
   as a Data Analyst at Accenture
 * Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content
   trends to inform strategic decisions
 * Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights
   for the client and internal stakeholders


    Project 2: 
    PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation on Forage - March 2024

 * Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to better
   understand clients and their data visualisation needs.
 * Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI
   dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond
   to client requests with well-designed solutions.
 * Strong communication skills reflected in the concise and informative email
   communication with engagement partners, delivering valuable insights and
   actionable suggestions based on data analysis.
 * Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly
   focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender
   balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment
   to data-driven decision-making.

    Project 3: 
    The SQL Murder Mystery Project:
The SQL Murder Mystery project involved using SQL queries to solve a fictional murder case that took place in SQL city. By analyzing a database containing evidence, witness testimonies, and suspect information, I formulated queries to uncover clues, identify suspects, and ultimately determine the perpetrator of the crime. Through deductive reasoning and careful analysis of the data, I successfully solved the mystery and identified the culprit behind the murder.
