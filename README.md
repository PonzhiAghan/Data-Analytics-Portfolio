# Data Analysis Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects where I've applied my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to extract insights and drive informed decision-making.

## Projects

### [Project 1: An Exploration of Loan Performance in the Prosper Dataset](https://github.com/PonzhiAghan/Data_analytics_with_python/blob/ec2cbbcb41ae7f5112dd3fead6cc3c488563e1c3/Python_Project_Notebook.ipynb)

- Completed cleaning and analyzing of the dataset to uncover the performance of the loan.
- Visualized the dataset to uncover the trends of delinquencies.

### [Project 2: The SQL Murder Mystery Project](https://github.com/PonzhiAghan/SQL-Project/tree/main)

- The SQL Murder Mystery project involved using SQL queries to solve a fictional murder case that took place in SQL city. 
- By analyzing the database containing evidence, witness testimonies, and suspect information, queries were formulated to uncover clues, identify suspects, and ultimately determine the perpetrator of the crime.
- Through deductive reasoning and careful analysis of the data, the mystery was solved.

### [Project 3: Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on Forage - February 2024](https://github.com/PonzhiAghan/Forage-Job-Simulation-Projects/tree/main/Accenture_Project)

- Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture.
- Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions.
- Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.


### [Project 4: PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation on Forage - March 2024](https://github.com/PonzhiAghan/Forage-Job-Simulation-Projects/tree/main/PowerBI%20projects%20(PwC%20Switzerland))

- Completed a job simulation where I strengthened my PowerBI skills to better understand clients and their data visualization needs.
- Demonstrated expertise in data visualization through the creation of Power BI dashboards that effectively conveyed KPIs, showcasing the ability to respond to client requests with well-designed solutions.
- Strong communication skills reflected in the concise and informative email communication with engagement partners, delivering valuable insights and actionable suggestions based on data analysis.
- Leveraged analytical problem-solving skills to examine HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and identified root causes for gender balance issues at the executive management level, highlighting a commitment to data-driven decision-making.

Each project folder contains:

- Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts: Code used for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
- Data folder: Raw and processed datasets used in the project.
- Folder containing the PowerBI and Excel files from the job simulation
- README.md: Detailed explanation of the project, including background, methodologies, and insights.

## Technologies Used
